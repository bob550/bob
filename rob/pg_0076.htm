<div style="position:absolute;top:74;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Mistress  Fitzooth never  saw  Gamewell or  her  brother  again.  Her  disorder  took  a sudden</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">and fatal  turn; and within a week Robin found  himself doubly an orphan등ithout home,</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:125;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">The Squire had refused to see the latter  and had sent him the reply to Robin's note by one</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:139;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">of  the servants.  Montfichet  was angered with  Warr enton  because  he had  been  deceived</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">by him.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Robin  laid  his mother  to  rest beside his  father.  That  was  as long as he might dare  stay  in</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Locksley.  Every   day   he  feared   to   be seized  by   Master   Monceux's  myrmidons.  Stuteley</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:204;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">kept watch on the road through Sherwood by day and War renton by night.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">The morning of the interment brought news of danger. One of the few faithful foresters of</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:269;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">journeying   to   Locksley.   Full   two   score   and   ten   of   them  there  were;   one,   the  leader,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:283;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">carrying a warrant for Robin's arrest. The forester hastened to save his young master .</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:306;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">The  time  was  short.  Robin  had  scarcely  pause  to  perform  the  last sad   offices above his</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:320;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">mother's grave ere he must be  flying for his life. His only  chance was to take to the woods</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:334;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">and hide in them.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:357;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Warrenton  urged him  to  seek  shelter in  the  thicker  forest  about Barnesdale, at the north-</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:371;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">western  end of  Sherwood. Whispers gave a story that the higher parts were honeycombed</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:385;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">with   strange   caves;   and   all  the   countryside   knew   that   away   in   Barnesdale   were   the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:399;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">headquar ters and camps of Will o' th' Green. It was the place of all others  for shelter; and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:413;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Stuteley became joyful in the thought of the adventures that must chance to them therein.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:436;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Warrenton  was  sober,   however,   over  it.  He  had   a  presentiment  that  the  days  would  be</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:450;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">hard and the food scanty and plain. Still 'twas a man's life, after all.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:473;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">They nearly plunged themselves into the hands of the enemy by mistaking their road.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:496;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">So  it chanced  that Robin  spied  his old  enemy  Simeon  Carfax  and  narrowly  missed  being</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:510;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">seen  also by him. The three fugitives hid themselves high up in the branches of a tree; and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:524;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">watched  with beating hearts their enemies hurrying onward to Locksley. With the band of</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:538;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">soldiers,   pikemen,   and   foresters   were  two   whom  Robin   observed   narrowly.   Sounds   of</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:552;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">their   talk  reached  his  ears;  and,   since  these  two   fellows  rode  somewhat  apart  fr om  the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:566;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">rest, Robin was able to distinguish their  chattering.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:589;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">He had unfailing ear for a voice. These were those traitors  in Will's band,  the two outlaws</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:603;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">whom  he  had  encountered  on   the  day  of   the  joustings  at  Nottingham Fair.   &quot;Roger  and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:617;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Micah,&quot;  murmured  Robin to  himself, after  listening  a while.  &quot;Yes,  those were  the  names</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">they used  </span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:140"><nobr><span class="ft2">then</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:631;left:161"><nobr><span class="ft1">. So,  friends, I am forearmed against you,  for I will step with  heavy foot in</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:645;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">your   concerns   by-and-by등hen   I   do   find   Master   Will   o'   th'   Green!   Roger드nd</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:659;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Micah듈'll not forget.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:682;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">Soon   as   they   had   passed,   the  three   slid   quietly   to   the   ground   and   thereafter   betook</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:696;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">themselves  very  cautiously  through  the wood.  Robin  determined to  find  Will soon  as he</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:710;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">might and lay his case  before him. The outlaw would give him refuge, no doubt.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:733;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1">The noise of the soldiers passed away in  a murmuring discordance, and the three fugitives</span></nobr></div>
