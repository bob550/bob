<div style="position:absolute;top:38;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The  Squire was an old man, with white hair curling from under a little round cap. He wore</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">long black robes, loose and rather monkish in  their fashion. He seemed as  unlike his sister</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">as Robin could well imagine, besides being so much more advanced in years. His face was</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">hairless and rather pale; but his eyes shone brightly. There was a very pleasant expression</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">in   the   lines   about   his   mouth,   and   his   manner   was  perfect.   He  embraced   Robin   with</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">kindliness; and real aff ection  for his sister  seemed to underlie his few words of  welcome.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">To   the   Friar   of   Copmanhurst  he  was   so   courteous  and  respectful  that  Robin   began   to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:136;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">wonder whether he himself had ever proper ly regarded  the clerk in  the  past. I f so great a</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">man  should  bow  to  him,  what ought Robin  to  do?  Robin  remembered  that  he had  often</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">ventured to rally and tease this good-natured master who had taught him his letters.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:187;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The  Squire  bade  them  follow  him,   so   soon  as  their   horses  and  baggage  had   been   duly</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">given  over  to  the servants and he  had  heard  the  for ester's  complaint against the outlaws.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:215;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The Squire made little comment, but fr owned.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:238;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">At the conclusion of the captain's repor t, they came into the hall, lighted by a thousand fat</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:252;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">tapers.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Sister  Nell—do  you  please  dismiss us,&quot;  said  the  Squire,  in  his courtly  way,  after  he had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">signed  to some waiting-maids to take charge of Mistress Fitzooth. &quot;I will lead Robin to his</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:303;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">chamber  myself,  and  show him  the arrangement we have made for  his stay  at  Gamewell.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Supper will be  served  us here  in less than  an hour.  Father,  your apartments shall be near</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:331;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">my own. Come with me, also.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:354;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">In  the  room allotted  to him Robin  found  new  and  gay  clothes  laid  out upon  a fair, white</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:368;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">bed,  with  a  little rush  mat beside  it.  A high  latticed  window  looked  out  upon  the  cour t,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">and  there was  a  bench  in  the  nook,  curiously   car ven  and  filled   with  stuffs and  naperies</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">the like of which Robin had never seen before.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The   walls   were   hung   with   tapestries,   and   very   fierce   and   amazing   were   the   pictures</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:433;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">embroidered   upon  them.  The  ceiling was  low  and  raftered   with  polished  beams.  Behind</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:447;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">the door was a sword suspended by a leathern belt.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;For you, kinsman,&quot; the Squire had said, smilingly.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin  lost  no time in  doffing his  green  jerkin  and  hose, and  then  he washed  himself and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">eagerly  essayed  his  new  habiliments.   When  the  sword  had  been   buckled  on,  our  young</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:521;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">hero   of   Locksley   felt   himself   equal   to   Will   o'   th'   Green   or   any   other   gallant   in</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:535;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Christendom.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">He  strode  along the corridors and found  his way  back to the great hall. There the  Master</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:572;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">of Gamewell and his mother awaited  him. Mistress Fitzooth's eyes shone approvingly, and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin slipped his f inger s into hers.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:609;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;I'll build  a castle  as fine as this,  mother mine, one of  these days,&quot; Robin  told  her:  and he</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">began  to  ask Master Montfichet questions as to  the number of claims-at-law that he must</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:637;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">have won  in  order  to  hold   so  splendid  a  domain.  The  Squire smilingly  told  him that  the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:651;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">King had given Gamewell to him as a rewar d for valor in battle many years agone.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Then  will I  fight for  the King,&quot;  cried  Robin, with   flashing eyes,  &quot;so  that  I  may  win  my</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:688;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">father Broadweald and all the lands of it.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:711;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;And   I   will  teach  you,   Robin:  be  sure  of  that,&quot;  said   old  George  Montfichet.   &quot;But  your</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:725;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">sword  must be swung for  the right King,  harkee.  Not f or rebellious princes will we cry  to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:739;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">arms; but for him whom God hath placed over us—Henry the Angevin.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
