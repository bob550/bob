<div style="position:absolute;top:38;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">upon the  top r ung of  a ladder,  and  slowly the truth  came to him.  Quickly  he  drew himself</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">up and whispered the discovery to the other.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">In an instant, then, their fears  were dispelled. Will would have gone down first into the  pit</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">had not Robin stayed  him. Stuteley was anxious  that  his young master  should  come to no</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">harm; and where a  danger appeared  an  ear thly one, he was quite willing to bear the br unt</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:117;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">of  it.  It  was thought  of  the  Yellow Woman   which  dried   up  all  the  courage  in  his  small,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">wiry body.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin  carefully   descended  the  ladder   and  f ound  himself  soon  upon   firm rocky   ground.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:168;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Stuteley   was   by   his   side   in   a  flash:  and   then   they   both   began   feeling  about   them  to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:182;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">ascertain the shape and character of this vault. Hardly had they commenced when Robin's</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">quick ear s took warning. Sound of a quiet approach was plain.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The darkness of  the  pit was suddenly  illumined,  and  the  lads found  themselves suddenly</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:233;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">faced by  the  beams of  a lanthorn  suspended  at  about a  man's  height  in  the air.  From the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:247;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">blackness behind the light they heard a voice—War renton's!</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:270;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Save  me,  masters,  but  you startled me rarely!&quot;  cried he, waving the lanthorn before him</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:284;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">to  make sure that these were no  ghosts in front of him. &quot;I have but this minute left  Master</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:298;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Montfichet,   having   carr ied   his   horse   to   him   in   safety.   He   rides   into   Nottingham</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:312;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">to-mor row, unattended. I would that I might be squire to him!&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:335;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Did   you   indeed   bring   horse  and  arms  down  this  ladder,   Warrenton?&quot;  enquired   Robin,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:349;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">with   his   suspicions   still   upon   him.   &quot;Truly   such   a   horse   should   be   worth   much   in</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:363;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Nottingham Fair! I  would dearly have loved to see so brave a business——&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:386;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Nay, nay, lor ding,&quot; answer ed  War renton,  with a half-laugh.  &quot;See&quot; —and  again he waved</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:400;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">his light, showing them where the underground passage, for such  it was, sloped upward  to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:414;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">another  and   larger  trap,  now   closed.  &quot;This   way   is  one   of   the  many  secret   ones  about</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:428;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Gamewell,  master: but  do  you keep the knowledge of  it to  yourselves,  I  beg,  unless you</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:442;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">would wish hurt to our future lord of Gamewell.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:465;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Warrenton   spoke   thus   with   significance,   to   show   Robin   that   he   was   not   to   think</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:479;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Geoffrey's claims to the estate would  be passed  by. Robin Fitzooth saw that his doubts of</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:493;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Warrenton had been unfair: and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:516;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Give me your  hand, Warrenton,  and help me to climb these steps,&quot; said he,  openly.  &quot;'Tis</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:530;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">dark, for  all your lamp; and I fain would feel fr iendly assistance, such as you can give.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:553;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">His  tones   rang   pleasantly   on   Warrenton's   ears,   and   forthwith   a   good-fellowship   was</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:567;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">heralded  between  them.   This  was  to   mean   much   to   the  young  hero  of   Locksley  in   the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:581;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">time  to  come; for   Warrenton's help  and  tuition  were to  make Robin  Fitzooth  something</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:595;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">far  better than the clever bowman he was already. This  night, in a  way,  saw the beginning</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:609;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">of Robin's for tunes and strange, adventur ous after -life.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:632;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to Gamewell that this passage-way led</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:646;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">from the hut in the pleasance to Sher wood; and that Geof frey for the time was hiding with</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:688;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">be discreet as the gr ave in this matter, f or in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:711;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The old servant spoke  no more.  In silence he led them back into Gamewell by the  private</span></nobr></div>
