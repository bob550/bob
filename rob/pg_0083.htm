<div style="position:absolute;top:375;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">nigh ended  with his death.  At  first there had  been some quarrelling and  jealousy  amongst</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:389;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">them as to who should be the new captain.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:412;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">There  were,  with  Robin   and   his  three  recruits,   twenty  and  two  men  all  told.   These had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:426;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">decided   upon   many   tests   between  themselves   in   order   to   settle   who   should   lead;  and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:440;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">when there wer e tests of archery Robin had beaten them all.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:528;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Then   there   had   been   fresh   bickerings,   and   they   were  once   nearly   discovered   by   the</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:653;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin had quite decided  to cast  in his lot with these men. He felt that they would be loyal</span></nobr></div>
