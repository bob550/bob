<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Take  him  then,  since   Locksley  will  have  it   so,   and   tie  his  legs  under   the  belly   of  his</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:562;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">earnest; and the f orester s sent staggering by after it along the road to Nottingham.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:585;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">When they  were  out of  sight, Robin  thanked  the outlaw again  for all  that  he had done for</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">them. Will merely shrugged his shoulders, as one who  would say:  &quot;'Tis a matter not wor th</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:613;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">breath&quot; ;  and,   giving  his   men   a   signal,   prepared   to   return   to   his   own   fastnesses.   Robin</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:627;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">begged   them   to   take   the   body   of   the   deer,   and,   with   small  reluctance,   the  outlaws</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:641;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">accepted the offer.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:664;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">The  Lincoln  men  bade  Robin  farewell also,   saying  that  they  would   now  go   on  towards</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:678;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">their   own   homes  with   a  light   heart:  for,   having   met   the  outlaws  and  found   them  most</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:729;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">towards  Gamewell,   although  Robin  really  had  little hope  now of  coming by  the P rince's</span></nobr></div>
