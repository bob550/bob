<div style="position:absolute;top:38;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">They  walked together into  Barnesdale,  and  Robin  showed  the boy  their  hiding-place and</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">presented  him to the rest.  He asked  that he might become one  of  their company,  and all</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">agreed. So he took the vow f ervently, and was given Little John's place f or the nonce.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin asked them not to mention  him by name, wishing to know more of Master Gilbert's</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">plans  ere disclosing  himself. The boy  was  full of  chatter,  and  had  news for them,  too.  He</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:117;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">gave  them  the  sequel  to   the  Bishop's  adventure,  and  told   how my  lord   of  Hereford  had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">come  into  Nottingham in  parlous  state—more dead  than  alive:  how  he had lain  prostrate</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:145;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">upon  a  sick-bed  in the  Sheriff's house for  the best part  of three days: how,  having br iefly</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">recovered,   he   had   made   a   full   statement   of   his   experiences,   and   had   cursed   the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:173;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">greenwood men with bell, book, and  candle: how he had sworn  that he they thought to be</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:187;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">dead—Robin of Locksley—was very much alive and full of wickedness.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Master   Monceux,   whom I   have  no  cause  to  love,&quot;  continued  Gilbert,  in  quick  speech,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;has bidden his archers and men to assemble,  and  has promised a round  sum for  the head</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:238;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">of  each  greenwood   man,   such  as  I  perceive  you   all  to   be,  and  since  I   am  now  of  your</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:252;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">company, friends, I suppose my head is worth as much as Master Robin's or any of your s?</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:266;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Which  of you  is Robin o' th' Hood? I  fain  would  look  upon a man who can  recover  from</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:280;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">death so valiantly.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:303;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Ber ry   and   Much   were,   both   together,   preparing   to   point   to   Robin,   forgetting   their</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:317;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">promise. Robin gave them a quick glance of warning. &quot;Come, friends, let us to br eakf ast,&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:331;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">he cried,  rising.  &quot;I am  sharp  set, and  soon  we  shall be hearing  from the Sheriff's  men,  no</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:345;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">doubt. Let us for tify ourselves withal.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:368;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">All  that morning  went by,  however,  without further  event.  The greenwood  men  became</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:382;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">uneasy.   All felt that  some  terrible plot  was being hatched  against  them,  and  their  unrest</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:396;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">grew   with   the   day.   Had   Little   John   turned   traitor?   And   was   he  now  preparing   their</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:410;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">enemies?</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:433;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Soon after  noon Robin  called  them together into the biggest of their  caves. He offer ed  to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:447;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">disguise himself and go into Nottingham—there to learn the best or worst.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Many  of   them made  objection   to   this,   saying  that  one  had   no  reason   to   take  more risk</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:484;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">than   another   in   this   free  company.   Robin   persuaded   them  at   last   to   his  own   way   of</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:498;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">thinking,  as  he had already  done before.  Unconsciously  they  were coming to  regard  him</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:512;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">as  their head,  although any one of  them would  have  fiercely  denied  this in  open  council.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:526;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin took a staff , and hurried towards the highroad for the second time that day.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:549;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">He  had   another   reason   for   making   this  adventure:  the   fond   hope   of   seeing   Mistress</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:563;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Marian.  Her brother—for so he felt sure this young  Gilbert must  be—had stirred afresh in</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:577;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin's hear t all his warm love for  her. He wondered what he could say to her.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:600;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Why, he could tell her of Gilbert's  escapade! Of  course she must be trembling at this  very</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:614;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">moment for the boy  and thinking him in  a thousand dangers! It was another duty added  to</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:628;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">that  to  which  Robin   bore towards the company  of  freemen.  He  doubled  and  trebled  his</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:642;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">pace.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:665;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Suddenly,  as  he  came  upon  the road,  the  sound  of   a lusty   singing  struck  upon   his ears.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:679;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Robin  became  aware  of  a shabby cart  and   a bushy   figure leading  a bony   horse,   and  the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:693;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">smell of fresh-killed meat. It was an honest butcher  on his way to market in Nottingham.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:716;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Give  you  good  day,  friend,&quot;  called  Robin  to  him.  &quot;You  have a  fair  load  there—what is</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:730;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">your price for it?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
