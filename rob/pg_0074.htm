<div style="position:absolute;top:52;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">of  their  peril.  Ford  offered  to   let  them all  go  f orth  free,  if   now they  would  yield  up  the</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">argument  Ford   swore   that   he   would   burn   the   house  over   their   heads   if   they   did   not</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:117;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">sur render it within  an  hour; and,  going back  to  the  garden,  he  began  to  bring in the loose</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:131;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">dry pieces of wood and sticks he and his men had collected in the night.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">At  three hours after noon,  Ford,  having given  one  more warning to them,  had bidden his</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:168;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">fellows do the worst. In a few moments the  smell of burning filled the house; and Mistress</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:182;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Fitzooth became as one distraught.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;We   had   two   women  left  to   us,&quot;  Warrenton   continued,  &quot;and   a  lad,   who   was  worth   as</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">much   as  a   man   to   me.   I   bade   them  open   the   door   softly,   and   rush   forth   whilst   the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:233;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">wretches were  employed  at  their  fiendish  work  in  the rear.   This we  did,  and   so  gained,</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:261;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">command  bowshot of  the whole front; and  I  had  given  the  lad  a  bow of  yours.  The two</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:275;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">maids, taking your  mother's hands,  pulled  her along under  the hedge until they gained the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:289;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">road. Then all three ran f uriously towar d the village.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:312;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;We  who   wer e left  behind   had  not long  to wait.  Presently,  one  came  round  to   the fr ont</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:326;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">with a piece  of flaming wood and boldly  thrust it thr ough  the nearest lattice.  Him I killed</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:340;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">at once with an arrow through the back. They were now but five against us. Presently two</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:354;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">others came stealthily from the back: but, seeing their companion dead, ran back hastily.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:377;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Master   Ford   appeared  next,   and  began  to  look   suspiciously  about him.   His  fellow had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:391;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">rolled   over  in  his  death- str uggles,  and  so  might  have been  slain  fr om  my  window  in  the</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:405;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">house-front.   Curls  of  smoke  were  coming  up  f rom  under   the  thatch   by  now;  and  Ford,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:419;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">making up his mind, ran out with the other s, and flung himself upon the door.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:442;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;We  had  left it  latched; and  so  it gave  enough  of  resistance in  his blind  attack  to  justify</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:456;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">him in believing it was still held  from within. It fell inwards, at last, with a crash; and Ford</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:470;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">spr ang triumphantly across the threshold.  His fellows  rushed after  him, trying now to beat</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:484;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">out the fir e.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:507;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Warrenton paused, and all fell again to watching the leaping flames.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:530;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Meanwhile I guessed that your  mother was safe, and  had  already  alarmed  the villager s,&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:544;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">continued the  old retainer.  &quot;So,  with a shout,  I  rushed out upon  the  villains, with  the lad,</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:558;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">and pulled  the broken  door back  to its place,  shutting them in,  that they  might enjoy their</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:572;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">own fell work  in all  security. Two  of them did  attempt escape just since by  leaping from</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:586;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">out of the window. But my bow was ready strung for them.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:609;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Have you  killed  four  men,  then,  Warrenton?&quot;  said  Robin,  his  blood  running cold.  Then</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:623;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">suddenly the full meaning of it flashed upon  him. &quot;And  Ford?&quot;  he  cried, with a gesture of</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:637;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">horror, &quot;and the two other s?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:660;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Nay,&quot;   said   War renton,   grimly.   &quot;I   had   come   round   here   to   see   whether   they   had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:674;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">preference  for  fire or  for  my   arrows,  having left the boy   to  guard  the front.  Then  I   saw</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:688;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">you and young Stuteley,  and in my chattering I  had nigh come to  forget them. But there is</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:702;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Master Ford beckoning to us from your  own room.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:725;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">A   frenzied,   dreadful  figur e  had   indeed   appear ed   for   a   brief   instant   amongst   the   thick</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:739;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">curling   smoke.   It   waved   two   hopeless   hands   out   towards   the   falling   dusk,   and   then</span></nobr></div>
