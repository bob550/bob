<div style="position:absolute;top:103;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Then   he  snatched  up   the  bag  by  the  two  corners  and  shook  out  the  rest  of  the  meal.  I t</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:154;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">He caught up his stick and began to belabor  them soundly.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:242;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">speeding   down   the   road,   with   Stuteley   recovered   already.   They   chanced   on   a  strange</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:279;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Ber ry,   old  Warrenton,  and  the outlaw were  dancing about in   an  agony  of  rage,  helpless</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:293;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">and   blind,   and   striking   vain   blows   at   empty   air.   The   man   with   the   three   hats   was</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:307;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">belaboring them  with his staff  so  thoroughly as to  have  become a man  with  no hat at all.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:321;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">They all were tumbled upon the road.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:344;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Why  all this haste?&quot; roared he, not  noticing Robin  or the others.  &quot;Why will you not tarry</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:358;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">for   my  money? 'Tis  strange   that  no  man  will  wait   upon  me  this  day,   whilst  I   am  in  so</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:386;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">encountered one of his many hats and ruthlessly kicked it aside.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:460;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Master Much ceased his occupation.  He turned  war ily about to Robin.  So soon as  he had</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:474;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">looked well at him, he dropped his stick and came over very fr ankly to him.</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:497;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;So it's the gipsy?&quot; said he, grinning all over his broad face. &quot;And they have neither flayed</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">you nor hanged you yet? And are these fellows with you?&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:534;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;We   are   the  free  men  of   Sherwood,&quot;   said   Robin,   &quot;and   were  coming  to  Lincoln   to  get</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:562;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">willing to join with us.&quot;</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:585;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Much   went  up   to  Stuteley,   and  craved  his  pardon   very   handsomely  at  this.  &quot; Had   I   but</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:599;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">looked at you,  friend,  I  might  have  known  you  for the other  gipsy,  and  these  fellows for</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:613;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">some  of  those  who   did  save you   both  from Master  Carfax.  That is  always my  way:  but</span></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:627;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">never  have  I  been so  sorry  for't  as on  this day,  for  now,  through  being too  hasty,  I  have</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:664;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">&quot;Nay, Master Miller, but that is not so,&quot; said Stuteley.</span></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:724;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft0">Much,   to   atone  for   his   misdeeds,   undertook   to   do   their   business   in   Lincoln;   and   set</span></nobr></div>
